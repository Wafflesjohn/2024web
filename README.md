Over the course of the past 7 years I have had a variety of different coding and computer experiences. Starting with MATLAB and c while I was in school for engineering. Complications arose and I eventually swapped to comp sci taking intro to java, visual basics, computer repair, and 2 python courses. I have mainly done front end work with html and CSS making project web pages. Aside from that I have made an app to act as a ramen shop order bord in visual basic, a video game base for an ant war game in java, and a group project to take printer info and display it where I was the main front end problem solver (helped with layout and made all the code work together). 
	After this class Iâ€™m hoping it will help give me a carer direction I can follow. I have been fairly lost in finding internship opportunities and finding a direction in which I want to go especially as the field seems to be in so much turmoil as of the last few years.
